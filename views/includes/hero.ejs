                Education is said to be the transmission of knowledge, culture and civilization. Since more than seven decades of its establishment by visionaries Shri Bhaikaka and Shri Bhikhabhai Saheb and inspiration by Shri Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Vallabh Vidyanagar of today seems like fulfilment of Tagor's vision of new India: "The inner spirit of India is calling us to establish, in this land, great centre, where all her intellectual forces will gather for the purpose of creation, and all her resources of knowledge and thought, Eastern and Western, will unite in perfect harmony." In the eighteenth year of the new millennium, we at Vallabh Vidyanagar, are poised on the brink of revolution. In this world, which moves at the speed of thought, our guiding principles used to change constantly, innovation and up gradation, both in terms of technology for our students and instil in them such high standards of knowledge and discipline that they can face any challenges anywhere in the world. Today, when aspirations are moving sky high and students are constantly challenged by a competitive and dynamic world, we strive to include confidence and competence in our students and equip them to face the challenges for years to come. I take the opportunity to introduce "A.D. PATEL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY" ,a college of largest private university of Gujarat 'CVM University'. Earlier the institute was affiliated with Sardar Patel University and Gujarat Technological University. We intend to make everything possible to extend helping hand for the students to get geared-up for the global spectrum in the 21st century, rightly called to be the century of knowledge.

                ADIT with a rich experience in engineering education for over two decades has established itself as one of the premier institutes in this region. We are part of largest private university of Gujarat "CVM University". We currently offer graduate courses in eleven branches of engineering in post-graduation in six disciplines. We have lush green campus, huge infrastructure with modern amenities, well equipped laboratories, a library with wide range of collections and highly experienced faculty members. We are committed to provide quality education to students and are constantly working to strive for better results which is evident as four of our departments got NBA accreditation till 2025. We are an ISO certified institute since 2005 and are amongst the first technical institutes to get ISO 9001:2015 certification.

                As an established professional institution, we are aware of the fact that our responsibility does not cease by just producing the graduates but help them to get suitable employment during their study tenure. We have very active Training and Placement Cell which aims at enhancing employability of our students by providing support and training of soft skills and latest technological knowledge. We also encourage students to excel in competitive examinations such as GATE, UPSC, GPSC, GRE, IELTS, etc.
                
                For holistic development of students our institute provides ample opportunities to nurture talents whether it be through sports, literary or cultural activities. We have a large sports complex and Gymnasium to train students in games like Cricket, Football, Basketball, Tennis, Badminton, Table Tennis, etc. We as an institute has excelled in cultural activities and students have demonstrated skills on various platforms such as Vibrant Gujarat, National Youth Festival etc
                
                With changing times, we are also evolving and are focused on research activities and industrial collaboration. This would in turn give valuable exposure to our students to prepare them for the challenges of future. We have already undertaken a large number of consultancy and research projects in different branches of engineering through funding agencies like ISRO, DST, GUJCOST, DBT, GSBTM, MOFP, etc.
